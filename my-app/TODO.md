Create a React application that fetches data from the following endpoint:


https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/posts



Display a list of posts, showing their title and body.
Implement the following features:
1. Add a "Load More" button at the bottom of the list to load additional posts. 
The initial load should display 5 posts, and subsequent loads should fetch and 
append 5 more posts to the list.
2. Implement a search bar that allows users to filter the posts based on their title 
or body.

3. Clicking on a post's title should expand and collapse the post's body to show 
or hide the full content.

Use React state and lifecycle methods or hooks to manage the data and UI 
interactions.

Requirements:
1. Use functional components and React hooks.
2. Use Axios or Fetch API to make the API call.
3. Use CSS or a CSS framework like Bootstrap for styling.
4. Implement error handling in case the API call fails.
5. Use appropriate React patterns for managing state and UI interactions.
6. Add pagination to the post list.
7. Implement sorting options to sort the posts by title or date.
8. Write unit tests to ensure the correctness of the components and 
functionality.
Bonus points:
1. Implement responsive design to make the application mobile-friendly.
Remember to initialize a new React project and install the necessary dependencies 
using Create React App or a similar tool before starting theÂ development.
